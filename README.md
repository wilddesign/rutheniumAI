RutheniumAI.js
Hi! I'm Wojciech Noga≈õ, a phd student in olefin metathesis at the University of Warsaw.

Save for chemistry, I program in JS stack and to solve the question of choosing the best catalyst for industrially important ethenolysis reaction I wrote this Node.js script that uses simple Machine Learning library to learn literature data for this reaction and allows a chemist to simulate activity of a new arbitrary catalyst. Obviously, first a set of proper descriptor has to be chosen by someone, since this is supervised learning :) provided are topological descriptors for both th NHC and benzylidene, but the underlyinng phenomena are much more complex and these are way too little to learn correct structure - activity relationship. It's just a starting point.

It allows to build different sets of structure(encoded as SMILES in input files)-derived descriptors for supervised learning.
